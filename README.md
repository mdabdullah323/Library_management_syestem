# Project Title: Library Management System using Python OOP

## Project Description:
- As part of my studies in Python, I developed a Library Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
- The project allows librarians to manage the library's inventory of books and track borrowing transactions.
- The system includes classes for the library, books, borrowers, and borrowing transactions.

## The Library Management System includes the following features:

1. Library Class: This class includes the name of the library and the total number of books in its inventory. It also has methods to add new books to the inventory, remove books from the inventory, and view the inventory.

2. Book Class: This class includes the title, author, and publisher of the book. It also includes the number of copies of the book available in the library and the number of copies currently borrowed.

3. Borrower Class: This class includes the name and contact details of the borrower who borrows a book.

4. Borrowing Transaction Class: This class includes the details of the borrowing transaction, such as the book borrowed, the borrower who borrowed the book, the borrowing date, and the due date.

I developed this project using Python OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation. I also used Python libraries such as datetime to track borrowing dates and due dates. I gained experience in software design and development, testing, and debugging. Overall, this project helped me strengthen my Python programming skills and understanding of OOP concepts.
